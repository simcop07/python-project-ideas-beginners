Python project ideas for beginners

This file gathers a list of the projects I created, if you want you can try writing them by yourself before seeing the solution. Good luck :)

### Check if a number is prime
 This script should ask for a user input of type int, then, using a function previously defined, check if it's prime or not and print to the console the result.

### Calculate the hypotenuse given the cathets
 You'll have to ask the user for two float numbers, then you'll use the formula i = sqrt(c1^2 + c2^2) to calculate the hypotenuse. 
 *Hint: use the math module*

### Dice roll
 This script will generate a random number in the interval [1,6] and print it to the console.
 *Hint: use the random module*

### Random password generator
 This script will ask the user for two numbers: the number of passwords to generate (n1) and the length of each one (n2). Then, the program will print n1 passwords of n2 characters.
 *Hint: use the random module*

### Calculate the age of a person given his birth year
 This script will ask the user to enter an integer, his birth year, and it will compare it with the current year, printing the user's age. Then it should ask the user if his birthday has already passed this year. If yes, it should subtract 1 from the final result.
 *Hint: use the datetime module*
